# Microlensing_LSST

You can find a C++  code that generates a big ensemble of microlensing events toward the Galactic bulge and disk. The code also generates synthetic data points 
taken by LSST. 
If you want to run the code on your own computer, you should first make extinction files by performing  "readext_new.py".  This code uses the 3D extinction map
made by Marshall et.  al., (2006), which can be found in: http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/453/635#/article

If you use this code for your scientific publications, you should acknowledge by citation to the following paper:
